# CatPhish
## The World's First Semantic-Vibe Dating Ecosystem
<!-- slide -->
# The Problem
## Dating Apps are Broken.
- **Visual Bias**: 80% of matches are based on the first 0.5 seconds of viewing a photo.
- **Signal Noise**: "Hiking" and "Tacos" are not personality traits. They are filler.
- **Ghosting**: 90% of conversations die because there is no shared "weird" to bond over.

> [!WARNING]
> We are drowning in options but starving for resonance.

# The Solution
## The Feline Proxy Protocol.
1.  **Identity Layering**: Users are represented by AI-generated cat avatars. No human faces initially.
2.  **Semantic Tuning**: Matches are made based on *answers to psychological dilemmas*, not self-reported bios.
3.  **The Reveal**: Human photos are only unlocked when resonance is proven.
<!-- slide -->
# The Secret Sauce
## The Insight Engine.
We don't just match. We **diagnose**.
- Our AI analyzes the *contradictions* in user answers.
- "You say you want peace, but you crave chaos."
- We provide daily "Consultant Notes" that act as a dating coach, keeping users engaged even when they don't match.

# Market Size
## The "Burned Out" Demographic.
- **TAM**: 300M+ Dating App Users globally.
- **SAM**: 50M+ Users experiencing "Swipe Fatigue" (Gen Z/Millennials).
- **SOM**: 5M+ Users open to "Slow Dating" / "Gamified" experiences.
<!-- slide -->
# Business Model
## Value > Volume.
1.  **Premium Resonance**: Pay to see "Shadow Traits" of potential matches.
2.  **Consultant Mode**: $9.99/mo for deeper daily psychoanalysis of your dating patterns.
3.  **B2B Licensing**: The "Feline Proxy" model (Anonymity -> Resonance -> Reveal) is applicable to **Recruiting**, **Insurance**, and **Corporate Team Building**.

# The Scalability
## Beyond Dating.
The **CatPhish Protocol** is a "Trust Engine".
- **Insurance**: Assess risk appetite based on decision dilemmas.
- **Legal**: Blind matching of clients to counsel based on ethical alignment.
- **Mental Health**: Low-stakes entry into therapy through "vibe checks".
<!-- slide -->
# The Roadmap

## Phase 2: The Platform.
