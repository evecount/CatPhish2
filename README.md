## The Problem (Situation/Task)

In an era where 1-in-4 dating profiles are AI bots and romance scams are a billion-dollar industry, visual identity has become a primary vulnerability. Traditional "identity verification" is easily bypassed by high-fidelity deepfakes. The challenge was to build a "Human-in-the-Loop" architecture that proves humanity through Semantic Logic rather than just facial symmetry.

## The Solution

Cat-Phish.com utilizes a Zero Trust framework to verify users. Using Gemini 3’s native multimodality in AI Studio, the system intercepts selfies and generates consistent "Cat Personas" (Privacy-by-Design), ensuring no PII is exposed. I implemented the Forward Propagation Consensus (FPC) model: a "Semantic Leaky ReLU" activation where users must pass high-context "Logic Traps" to unlock the original image. The project integrates Firebase for secure data handling and was deployed via Antigravity CLI for streamlined environment management.

## The Result (Result)

Cat-Phish.com effectively neutralizes automated "romantic script" bots by requiring perspective-shifting responses that AI cannot yet mimic. It turns the Alice/Bob/Eve triad into a security feature, using an internal "Eve" agent to audit conversation consistency. The result is a lighter-hearted app with a serious mission: proving that cybersecurity fundamentals like Behavioral Biometrics and MitM defense are the future of digital social trust.
